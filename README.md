# markov-model
This repository constitutes a python implementation of a k-order Markov model for text-based speech recognition. Key files are:

Hashtable.py
Contains a linear-probing hashtable, with logical deletion and default values for deleted/non-existent keys.

Markov.py
Code for creating a Markov class that accepts input text to "build" a speaker model using on the hashtable.py. Markov.py also includes a function (identify_speaker) that calculates the most likely speaker of an unknown sample given two known samples.

Below is a graph benchmarking the performance of this hashtable implementation compared to Python's dictionary
